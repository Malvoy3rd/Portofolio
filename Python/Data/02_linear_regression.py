### How to run the code

This tutorial is an executable [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) hosted on [Jovian](https://www.jovian.ai) (don't worry if these terms seem unfamiliar; we'll learn more about them soon). You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.

#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)

The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Colab**. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is a free online platform for running Jupyter notebooks using Google's cloud infrastructure. You can also select "Run on Binder" or "Run on Kaggle" if you face issues running the notebook on Google Colab.


#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally

To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.

>  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc. instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the "Kernel > Restart & Clear Output" or "Edit > Clear Outputs" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top.

Before we begin, we need to install the required libraries. The installation of PyTorch may differ based on your operating system / cloud environment. You can find detailed installation instructions here: https://pytorch.org .

"""## Introduction to Linear Regression

In this tutorial, we'll discuss one of the foundational algorithms in machine learning: *Linear regression*. We'll create a model that predicts crop yields for apples and oranges (*target variables*) by looking at the average temperature, rainfall, and humidity (*input variables or features*) in a region. Here's the training data:

![linear-regression-training-data](https://i.imgur.com/6Ujttb4.png)

In a linear regression model, each target variable is estimated to be a weighted sum of the input variables, offset by some constant, known as a bias :

```
yield_apple  = w11 * temp + w12 * rainfall + w13 * humidity + b1
yield_orange = w21 * temp + w22 * rainfall + w23 * humidity + b2
```

Visually, it means that the yield of apples is a linear or planar function of temperature, rainfall and humidity:

![linear-regression-graph](https://i.imgur.com/4DJ9f8X.png)

The *learning* part of linear regression is to figure out a set of weights `w11, w12,... w23, b1 & b2` using the training data, to make accurate predictions for new data. The _learned_ weights will be used to predict the yields for apples and oranges in a new region using the average temperature, rainfall, and humidity for that region. 

We'll _train_ our model by adjusting the weights slightly many times to make better predictions, using an optimization technique called *gradient descent*. Let's begin by importing Numpy and PyTorch.
"""

import numpy as np
import torch

"""## Training data

We can represent the training data using two matrices: `inputs` and `targets`, each with one row per observation, and one column per variable.
"""

# Input (temp, rainfall, humidity)
inputs = np.array([[73, 67, 43], 
                   [91, 88, 64], 
                   [87, 134, 58], 
                   [102, 43, 37], 
                   [69, 96, 70]], dtype='float32')

"""We've separated the input and target variables because we'll operate on them separately. Also, we've created numpy arrays, because this is typically how you would work with training data: read some CSV files as numpy arrays, do some processing, and then convert them to PyTorch tensors.

![matrix-mult](https://i.imgur.com/WGXLFvA.png)

We can define the model as follows:
"""

inputs @w.t()+b

def model(x):
    return x @ w.t() + b

"""`@` represents matrix multiplication in PyTorch, and the `.t` method returns the transpose of a tensor.

"""You can see a big difference between our model's predictions and the actual targets because we've initialized our model with random weights and biases. Obviously, we can't expect a randomly initialized model to *just work*.

## Loss function

Before we improve our model, we need a way to evaluate how well our model is performing. We can compare the model's predictions with the actual targets using the following method:

* Calculate the difference between the two matrices (`preds` and `targets`).
* Square all elements of the difference matrix to remove negative values.
* Calculate the average of the elements in the resulting matrix.

The result is a single number, known as the **mean squared error** (MSE).
"""

def mse(t1, t2):
    diff = t1 - t2
    return torch.sum(diff * diff) / diff.numel()

"""`torch.sum` returns the sum of all the elements in a tensor. The `.numel` method of a tensor returns the number of elements in a tensor. Let's compute the mean squared error for the current predictions of our model."""

# Compute loss
loss = mse(preds, targets)
print(loss)

"""Here’s how we can interpret the result: *On average, each element in the prediction differs from the actual target by the square root of the loss*. And that’s pretty bad, considering the numbers we are trying to predict are themselves in the range 50–200. The result is called the *loss* because it indicates how bad the model is at predicting the target variables. It represents information loss in the model: the lower the loss, the better the model.

## Compute gradients

With PyTorch, we can automatically compute the gradient or derivative of the loss w.r.t. to the weights and biases because they have `requires_grad` set to `True`. We'll see how this is useful in just a moment.
"""

# Compute gradients

"""## Adjust weights and biases to reduce the loss

The loss is a [quadratic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_function) of our weights and biases, and our objective is to find the set of weights where the loss is the lowest. If we plot a graph of the loss w.r.t any individual weight or bias element, it will look like the figure shown below. An important insight from calculus is that the gradient indicates the rate of change of the loss, i.e., the loss function's [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope) w.r.t. the weights and biases.

If a gradient element is **positive**:

* **increasing** the weight element's value slightly will **increase** the loss
* **decreasing** the weight element's value slightly will **decrease** the loss

![postive-gradient](https://i.imgur.com/WLzJ4xP.png)

If a gradient element is **negative**:

* **increasing** the weight element's value slightly will **decrease** the loss
* **decreasing** the weight element's value slightly will **increase** the loss

![negative=gradient](https://i.imgur.com/dvG2fxU.png)

The increase or decrease in the loss by changing a weight element is proportional to the gradient of the loss w.r.t. that element. This observation forms the basis of _the gradient descent_ optimization algorithm that we'll use to improve our model (by _descending_ along the _gradient_).

We can subtract from each weight element a small quantity proportional to the derivative of the loss w.r.t. that element to reduce the loss slightly.

## Machine Learning vs. Classical Programming

The approach we've taken in this tutorial is very different from programming as you might know it. Usually, we write programs that take some inputs, perform some operations, and return a result. 

However, in this notebook, we've defined a "model" that assumes a specific relationship between the inputs and the outputs, expressed using some unknown parameters (weights & biases). We then show the model some know inputs and outputs and _train_ the model to come up with good values for the unknown parameters. Once trained, the model can be used to compute the outputs for new inputs.

This paradigm of programming is known as _machine learning_, where we use data to figure out the relationship between inputs and outputs. _Deep learning_ is a branch of machine learning that uses matrix operations, non-linear activation functions and gradient descent to build and train models. Andrej Karpathy, the director of AI at Tesla Motors, has written a great blog post on this topics, titled [Software 2.0](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35).

This picture from book [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python) by Francois Chollet captures the difference between classical programming and machine learning:

![](https://i.imgur.com/oJEQe7k.png)

Keep this picture in mind as you work through the next few tutorials.

## Commit and update the notebook

As a final step, we can record a new version of the notebook using the `jovian` library.
"""

import jovian

jovian.commit(project='02-linear-regression')

"""Note that running `jovian.commit` a second time records a new version of your existing notebook.
